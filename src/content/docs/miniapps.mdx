Farcaster Mini Apps (previous Frames) provide an easy way for developers to build rich in-app experiences, and Orbiter makes it simple to host one! Follow our quickstart below or read more in depth the pieces that go into Mini Apps.

## Quickstart

<Steps>
1. Create a [free account](https://app.orbiter.host) and get an [API key](https://app.orbiter.host/api-keys)

2. Install the [orbiter-cli](/cli) and authorize it
   ```bash
   npm i -g orbiter-cli

   orbiter auth
   ```

3. Launch a Mini App in one command
   ```bash
   orbiter miniapp
   ```
</Steps>

## How Mini Apps Work

Mini Apps have three primary components that let them run inside Farcaster

### SDK

The [Mini App SDK](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/docs/sdk/context) is used to send messages to a Farcaster client and receive things like context (user who is interacting, their FID, PFP, etc). Initialization is done through importing the SDK and using `sdk.actions.ready()`.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="React">

    ```typescript {14}
    import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react'
    import './App.css'
    import sdk from '@farcaster/frame-sdk';
    import { Context } from '@farcaster/frame-sdk';

    function App() {
      const [isSDKLoaded, setIsSDKLoaded] = useState(false);
      const [context, setContext] = useState<Context.FrameContext>();
      const [isContextOpen, setIsContextOpen] = useState(false);

      useEffect(() => {
        const load = async () => {
          setContext(await sdk.context);
          sdk.actions.ready();
        };
        if (sdk && !isSDKLoaded) {
          setIsSDKLoaded(true);
          load();
        }
      }, [isSDKLoaded]);
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="HTML">
  ```html {3}
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@farcaster/frame-sdk/dist/index.min.js"></script>
  <script>
      frame.sdk.actions.ready();
  </script>
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

As long as you are using the SDK in a client enviornment it should be able to communicate with Farcaster.

### Embed

Similar to how you might use `<meta>` tags to provide opengraph data, Farcaster will look for a special meta tag that it will use to load the app launcher in a feed.

```html
<meta name="fc:frame" content="<stringified Embed JSON>" />
```

```typescript
{
  "version": "next",
  "imageUrl": "https://yoink.party/framesV2/opengraph-image",
  "button": {
    "title": "ðŸš© Start",
    "action": {
      "type": "launch_frame",
      "name": "Yoink!",
      "url": "https://yoink.party/framesV2",
      "splashImageUrl": "https://yoink.party/logo.png",
      "splashBackgroundColor": "#f5f0ec"
    }
  }
}
```

A full schema can be found [here](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/docs/specification#schema).

### Manifest

In order for Farcaster to store data about an app and allow users to add it or for it to be featured in the store, it must have a `farcaster.json` file located in `/.well-known`. We would recommend checking out the [full spec](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/docs/specification#manifest), but here is an example of what it might look like:

```json
{
  "accountAssociation": {
    "header": "eyJmaWQiOjM2MjEsInR5cGUiOiJjdXN0b2R5Iiwia2V5IjoiMHgyY2Q4NWEwOTMyNjFmNTkyNzA4MDRBNkVBNjk3Q2VBNENlQkVjYWZFIn0",
    "payload": "eyJkb21haW4iOiJ5b2luay5wYXJ0eSJ9",
    "signature": "MHgwZmJiYWIwODg3YTU2MDFiNDU3MzVkOTQ5MDRjM2Y1NGUxMzVhZTQxOGEzMWQ5ODNhODAzZmZlYWNlZWMyZDYzNWY4ZTFjYWU4M2NhNTAwOTMzM2FmMTc1NDlmMDY2YTVlOWUwNTljNmZiNDUxMzg0Njk1NzBhODNiNjcyZWJjZTFi"
  },
  "frame": {
    "version": "1",
    "name": "Yoink!",
    "iconUrl": "https://yoink.party/logo.png",
    "homeUrl": "https://yoink.party/framesV2/",
    "imageUrl": "https://yoink.party/framesV2/opengraph-image",
    "buttonTitle": "ðŸš© Start",
    "splashImageUrl": "https://yoink.party/logo.png",
    "splashBackgroundColor": "#f5f0ec",
    "webhookUrl": "https://yoink.party/api/webhook"
  }
}
```

The best way to generate this is to visit the [Farcaster Developer Portal](https://warpcast.com/~/developers) and use the "Create Mini App" in the top right. The `frame` information is pretty standard info, and the `webhookUrl` is optional. What might trip most up is the `accountAssociation`. This is a special object of signatures to verify that a mini app belongs to it's creator so users can trust or question it's safety and security. In order to generate the signature visit the [Mini App Builder](https://warpcast.com/~/developers/new) and click the "Register with Warpcast" button at the bottom right.


## Client vs Backend

Orbiter currently only supports static apps, which means they must be rendered client side. If you need a backend for your Mini App on Orbiter we would highly recommend using [Hono](https://hono.dev) on a Cloudflare Worker. It's can be initialized and deployed in just a few commands!

```bash
npm create hono@latest my-app # Select Cloudflare Workers

cd my-app

npm install

npx wrangler login

npm run deploy
```
