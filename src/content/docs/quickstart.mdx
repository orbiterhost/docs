Welcome to Orbiter, the easiest way to host static websites! In this brief walkthrough we’ll show you how to launch a site in no time.

<Steps>
1. Create a [free account](https://app.orbiter.host) and get an [API key](https://app.orbiter.host/api-keys)

2. Install the [orbiter-cli](/cli) and authorize it
   ```bash
   npm i -g orbiter-cli

   orbiter auth
   ```

3. Launch your app in one command
   ```bash
   orbiter deploy
   ```

   ```bash
   ℹ No configuration found or options provided. Starting setup...
   ✔ Would you like to: Create new site
   ✔ Enter a subdomain for your new site: launch-my-site
   ✔ Enter build command: npm run build
   ✔ Enter build directory: dist
   ✔ Configuration created
   ✔ Build completed
