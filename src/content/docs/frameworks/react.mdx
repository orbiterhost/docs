In this guide we’ll show you how you can host your React project on Orbiter.

## Setup

Start up a new React project with the following command:

```bash
npm create vite@latest orbiter-site
```

Give you project Select the React option and then choose your flavor. Then it should give you the following commands:

```bash
cd orbiter-site
npm install
npm run dev
```

Go ahead and run each of those one at a time, then you should have a local dev server at [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173) which you can visit and see the starter template.

## Build

Once you have your site edited and ready to go, close the dev server and run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This should create a `dist` folder in your project directory.

## Deploy

Login to app.orbiter.host, then click new site in the top right. From there you can either drag the `dist` folder into the drop zone or use the “select folder” button snd locate the `dist` folder. Choose a subdomain for your free [orbiter.website](http://orbiter.website) handle, then click submit.
