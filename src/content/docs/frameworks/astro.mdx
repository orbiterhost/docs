In this guide we’ll show you how you can host your Astro project on Orbiter.

## Setup

Start up a new Astro project with the following command:

```bash
npm create astro@latest orbiter-site
```

The Houston bot will ask which template you want to use, if you want to install dependencies, and if you want to initialize the project with Git. We recommend starting with the minimal template and selecting `yes` for the latter two questions.

Once complete run the following command to move into the project and spin up the dev server

```bash
cd orbiter-site
npm run dev
```

Go ahead and run each of those one at a time, then you should have a local dev server at [`http://localhost:4321`](http://localhost:4321) which you can visit and see the starter template.

## Build

Once you have your site edited and ready to go, close the dev server and run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This should create a `dist` folder in your project directory.

## Deploy

Login to app.orbiter.host, then click new site in the top right. From there you can either drag the `dist` folder into the drop zone or use the “select folder” button snd locate the `dist` folder. Choose a subdomain for your free [orbiter.website](http://orbiter.website) handle, then click submit.

In just a moment your site should be ready to visit, which you can do by clicking on the domain on the site card!

If you prefer a CLI experience check out the docs [here](/cli). It's as simple as these three commands:

```bash
npm i -g orbiter-cli

orbiter login -p google # or github

orbiter create -d my-site ./dist
```
