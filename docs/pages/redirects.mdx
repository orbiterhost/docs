# Redirects

Redirects and Custom 404 pages are only available on paid plans

With Orbiter you can setup redirects to help navigate your users to new paths or completely external ones. We follow the same patterns as other static site hosting platforms for redirects so you can easily move your redirects to Orbiter or vice versa.

To add redirects, create a file called `_redirects` with no file extension. You will want this to be in your root build folder, ie something like your `public` folder so it can be accessed at `https://mysite.com/_redirects`. The contents of the file should look like this:

```yaml
/old-path   /new-path
/some-post  /post/some-post
/orbiter    https://orbiter.host
```

This pattern follows a simple `source -> destination` pattern, where the `source` is the old page and the `destination` is where you want to redirect your user to. One more optional parameter in the layout is a custom status code following `destination`.

```yaml
/old-path   /new-path               301 # [!code hl]
/some-post  /post/some-post         307 # [!code hl]
/orbiter    https://orbiter.host
```

By default Orbiter will use a `301` status code if not specified in the redirects file.

Once you have this file saved simply deploy your app to Orbiter.

```bash [terminal]
orbiter deploy
```

That's it! We handle the rest 😎

## Custom 404 Page

At the moment if someone tries to visit a path on your app that does not exist they'll simply be directed to the root path `/`. If you would prefer to redirect them to a custom 404 page you can designate it in the `_redirects` file using the `404` as the source, and the path to your custom 404 page as the `destination`.

```yaml
/old-path   /new-path
/some-post  /post/some-post
/orbiter    https://orbiter.host
404         /404 # [!code focus]
```

With this setup anyone who visits a non existant page they will be sent to the destination path.
