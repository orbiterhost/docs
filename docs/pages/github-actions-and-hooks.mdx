# GitHub Actions & Hooks

With Orbiter's API and CLI you can easily add GitHub integrations to enable automated deployments. Both GitHub Actions and Commit Hook flows do require to have a site already deployed and an API key ready to use.

:::note
Before following these guides be sure to grab an [api key](https://app.orbiter.host/api-keys)!

## GitHub Actions

Orbiter's GitHub Actions allow you to automatically deploy your site after each commit based on rules and other integrations you might be using

::::steps

### Deploy Your Site

Before you can use the Orbiter GitHub action you will need to deploy your site to Orbiter first! Follow the [quickstart](/quickstart) guide to get started!

### Create and Store an API Key

Visit the [API Keys](https://app.orbiter.host/api-keys) page inside the Orbiter App and create a new key with Admin permissions.

Once you have a key, navigate to your GitHub project, then go to `Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions`. Click New repository secret, then use `ORBITER_API_KEY` as the name, and then paste the secret into the box below.

### Create the Workflow

In the root of your project make a new directory called `.github` in the root of your folder, then add a directory called `worflows` to it. Finally make a new file called `deploy.yaml`. Alternatively you can run this in the terminal:

```bash [terminal]
mkdir -p .github/workflows && touch .github/workflows/deploy.yaml
```

```
- .github
  - workflows
    - deploy.yaml
```

Inside the `deploy.yaml` file paste in the following configuration:

```yaml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Deploy to Orbiter
        uses: orbiterhost/orbiter-github-actions@v0.1.4 # Update with latest version
        with:
          project-name: "mysite" # Name of your project
          build-dir: "./dist" # Name of the build output directory
          api-key: ${{ secrets.ORBITER_API_KEY }} # Will use repository secret
          # Optional inputs with their defaults
          node-version: "20.x" # Optional, defaults to '20.x'
          build-command: "npm run build" # Optional, defaults to 'npm run build'
```

Near the bottom you will see several fields that you will need to fill out for your particular project:

- `project-name`: This would be the name you chose when you made the site. For example, the site `mysite.orbiter.website` the name would be `mysite`
- `build-dir`: The name your build directory, e.g. dist, out, public, etc
- `api-key`: This can be created on the API Keys Page of the Orbiter App
- `node-version` (Optional): Define the version of Node you want to use, will default to v20 which is the minumum
- `build-command` (Optional): Define the command used to build, default is npm run build

Once all of that information is set go ahead and save the file.

### Git Push!

On your next commit to your main branch you should see under the actions tab that your site is building!

::::

### Alternative Flows

There are some cases where your site may not use a JavaScript framework or something that needs to build separately. In these cases you can build your own workflow that is similar to the one above, except you can manually setup your install and build steps. The only thing you really need for Orbiter is the `update` comand.

```yaml
# ...Rest of the flow
      - name: install dependencies
        run: |
          bundle install --path vendor/bundle
          bundle exec jekyll build --config _config.yml,_config_development.yml --destination public

      - name: Deploy to Orbiter
        shell: bash
        env:
          ORBITER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ORBITER_API_KEY }}
          SOURCE: github-action
        run: npx orbiter-cli update -d my-site public # [!code focus]
```

## Git Commit Hooks

Another apporach to automating deployments is creating a post-commit hook that runs anytime you make a local commit. It uses the same API/CLI under the hood and will require having an existing project as well as an API key.

### 1. Deploy Your Site

Before you can use the Orbiter GitHub action you will need to deploy your site to Orbiter first! Follow the [quickstart](/quickstart) guide to get started!

### 2. Create and Store an API Key

Visit the [API Keys](https://app.orbiter.host/api-keys) page inside the Orbiter App and create a new key with Admin permissions. Once you have created it store the key in a `.env` file at the root of your project with the following:

```
ORBITER_API_KEY=<YOUR KEY>
```

### 3. Create the Hook

If your project has already been initialized by Git you might see a `.git` folder in the root of the project. In there is a folder called `hooks` where we'll make a new file called `post-commit`

```bash [terminal]
touch .git/hooks/post-commit
```

Open that file and paste in the following contents

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Path: .git/hooks/post-commit
# Make sure to make this file executable: chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit

echo "Running Orbiter deployment..."
# Run the CLI command here
npm run build && npx orbiter-cli update -d <your domain> <your build directory> #[!code hl]

# Alternatively you can use the --siteId instead
# orbiter update -s <site-id> dist

# Check if the command was successful
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Orbiter update completed successfully"
    exit 0
else
    echo "Orbiter update failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

In the highlighed line above you'll see some of the details you need to fill in for your particluar project. This would include the build command (e.g. `npm run build`), the domain of your site (if your site is `mysite.orbiter.website` then the domain to use here would be `mysite`), and your output build directory (e.g. `out`, `dist`, etc).

Once you have customized that file and saved it you will need to make the file an executable by running this command:

```bash [terminal]
sudo chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
```

### 4. Commit Away!

Now if you make a commit it should automatically build and deploy your site!

```bash [terminal]
git add .

git commit -m "Testing Git hooks!"
```
