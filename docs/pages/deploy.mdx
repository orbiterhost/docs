# Deploy

Orbiter makes it easy to deploy a static site, no matter what your preference is! In this doc we'll go over multiple ways you can deploy with Orbiter.

:::tip

:::


## CLI

Install and authorize the `orbiter-cli` with your [API Key](https//app.orbiter.host/api-keys)

```bash [terminal]
npm i -g orbiter-cli

orbiter auth
```

Create a new site from a template

```bash [terminal]
orbiter new
```

Deploy an existing project

```bash [terminal]
orbiter deploy
```

This will setup your project with an `orbiter.json` configuration file that will be referenced for future deployments or updates where you can just run `deploy` again!

## Web App

The Orbiter App makes it simple to deploy your site. Simply login, click on "Create Site", then select your File or Folder, give it a domain, and deploy!

## Automated GitHub Deployments

For those who like to just `git push` and forget about it, the [Orbiter GitHub Actions](/github-actions-and-hooks) are the perfect solution. Check out our guide on how to use them!

## API

If you want to build Orbiter deployments elsewhere you can use our API!

First you will want to make an API Key from our [API Keys Page](https://app.orbiter.host/api-keys) from within the Orbiter app.

Orbiter used [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud) to deploy sites to IPFS, so in order to deploy a site through the API you will need to upload it first. Orbiter provides an `upload_key` endpoint that will give you a temproary Pinata API key to upload with. Once you upload the file or folder and get the CID back, you can use this CID in the Orbiter API call to create a site.

```typescript
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata-web3"

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: "",
  pinataGateway: ""
})

const keyReq = await fetch("https://api.orbiter.host/keys/upload_key", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "X-Orbiter-API-Key": "<YOUR-API-KEY>"
  },
  body: null
})

const keyRes = await keyReq.json()
const files: File[] = [] // Get a folder of files either locally or through a front end
const upload = await pinata.upload.fileArray(files).key(keyRes.data)

const deploySite = await fetch("https://api.orbiter.host/sites", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "X-Orbiter-API-Key": "<YOUR-API-KEY>"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    cid: upload.IpfsHash,
    subdomain: "my-site"
  })
})
```
