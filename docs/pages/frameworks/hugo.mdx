# Hugo

In this guide we’ll show you how you can host your Hugo project on Orbiter.

## Setup

[Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/macos/) on your machine, then start up a new Hugo project with the following command:

```bash [terminal[
hugo new site orbiter-site
```

Once complete run the following commands

```bash [terminal]
cd orbiter-site
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
echo "theme = 'ananke'" >> hugo.toml
hugo server
```

Go ahead and run each of those one at a time, then you should have a local dev server at [`http://localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) which you can visit and see the starter template.

Let's add a new post by running the following command:

```bash [terminal]
hugo new content content/posts/my-first-post.md
```

This will create a new post in the content folder. Open the file and add the following contents

```markdown
+++
date = '2025-01-20T15:32:29-06:00'
draft = false
title = 'My First Post'
+++

## Hello, Orbiter!

This is a simple example post that will be part of my Hugo site. It will be hosted on [Orbiter](<https://orbiter.host>).
```

Stop the server with `ctrl-c` then restart it with the command below

```bash [terminal]
hugo server -D
```

## Build

Once you have your site edited and ready to go, close the dev server and run the command below

```bash [terminal]
hugo
```

This should create a `public` folder in your project directory which is where all the website files will live.

## Deploy

Install and authorize the `orbiter-cli` with your [API Key](https//app.orbiter.host/api-keys)

```bash [terminal]
npm i -g orbiter-cli

orbiter auth
```

Deploy in one command

```bash [terminal]
orbiter deploy
```

Select the following settnings for Hugo
- Build Command: `hugo`
- Build Directory: `public`

Alternatively you can deploy through the web app by first building the site with the `hugo`

Then login to [app.orbiter.host](https://app.orbiter.host), then click new site in the top right. From there you can either drag the `public` folder into the drop zone or use the “select folder” button snd locate the `public` folder. Choose a subdomain for your free [orbiter.website](http://orbiter.website) handle, then click submit.
