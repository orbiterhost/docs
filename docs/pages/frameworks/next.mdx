# Next.js

In this guide we’ll show you how you can host your Next.js project on Orbiter.

:::note
Orbiter only supports static sites, which means features like API routes or server side functions in Next.js will not work.
:::

## Setup

Start up a new Next.js project with the following command:

```bash [terminal]
npx create-next-app@latest orbiter-site
```

Select your preferences for your app, then once complete run the following command to move into the project and spin up the dev server

```bash [terminal]
cd orbiter-site
npm run dev
```

Go ahead and run each of those one at a time, then you should have a local dev server at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) which you can visit and see the starter template.

Once you have your site edited and ready to go, close the dev server and add the following line to the `next.config.ts` file.

```typescript
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  output: 'export' // [!code focus]
};

export default nextConfig;
```


## Deploy

Install and authorize the `orbiter-cli` with your [API Key](https//app.orbiter.host/api-keys)

```bash [terminal]
npm i -g orbiter-cli

orbiter auth
```

Deploy in one command

```bash [terminal]
orbiter deploy
```

Alternatively you can deploy through the web app. First build the project.

```bash [terminal]
npm run build
```

This should create a `out` folder in your project directory.

Login to app.orbiter.host, then click new site in the top right. From there you can either drag the `out` folder into the drop zone or use the “select folder” button snd locate the `out` folder. Choose a subdomain for your free [orbiter.website](http://orbiter.website) handle, then click submit.

In just a moment your site should be ready to visit, which you can do by clicking on the domain on the site card!

If you prefer a CLI experience check out the docs [here](/cli). It's as simple as these three commands:
