::::steps

### Install Bun

Install [Bun](https://bun.sh) to your machine

:::code-group

```bash [Linux/MacOS]
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

```bash [Windows]
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
```

:::

### Install Orbiter CLI

Install the Orbiter CLI with the latest version

```bash [terminal]
bun install -g orbiter-cli@latest
```

### Create a New bhvr Project

Orbiter includes a special version of bhvr that has everything you need to have a fullstack app

```bash [terminal]
orbiter new --template bhvr
```

This will automatically install, build, and deploy the client and server packages of your bhvr project!

### Deploy

Whenever you need to upload, simply run any of the `deploy` commands

```bash [terminal]
bun run deploy:client
bun run deploy:server
bun run deploy # Deploys both client and server
```
