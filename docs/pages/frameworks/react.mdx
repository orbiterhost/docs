# React

In this guide we’ll show you how you can host your React project on Orbiter.

## Quickstart

Install and authorize the `orbiter-cli` with your [API Key](https//app.orbiter.host/api-keys)

```bash [terminal]
npm i -g orbiter-cli

orbiter auth
```

Start up and deploy a React app in one command

```bash [terminal]
orbiter new
```

## Manual Setup

Start up a new React project with the following command:

```bash [terminal]
npm create vite@latest orbiter-site
```

Give you project Select the React option and then choose your flavor. Then it should give you the following commands:

```bash [terminal]
cd orbiter-site
npm install
npm run dev
```

Go ahead and run each of those one at a time, then you should have a local dev server at [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173) which you can visit and see the starter template.

## Deploy

Using the `orbiter-cli` you can run the following command to deploy and update your site

```bash [terminal]
orbiter deploy
```

Alternatively you can build the site first to upload through the web app

```bash [terminal]
npm run build
```

Login to [app.orbiter.host](https://app.orbiter.host), then click new site in the top right. From there you can either drag the `dist` folder into the drop zone or use the “select folder” button snd locate the `dist` folder. Choose a subdomain for your free [orbiter.website](http://orbiter.website) handle, then click submit.
