### `auth`

An alternative way to authenticate the CLI is with an Orbiter API key. This can be obtained at [app.orbiter.host/api-keys](https://app.orbiter.host/api-keys). You can either just run `orbiter auth` and it will prompt you for the key and not display it visibly, or if you're using the CLI in an automation you can use the `--key` flag.

:::tip
Orbiter will also look for the enviornment variable `ORBITER_API_KEY` for an API key to authorize the CLI
:::

```bash [terminal]
orbiter auth
> Authenticate using an API key

OPTIONS:
  --key, -k <str> - Your API key [optional]

FLAGS:
  --help, -h - show help

USAGE:

orbiter auth # Will prompt you for the key

orbiter auth --key <YOUR_API_KEY> # Will bypass the prompt and authorize
```
