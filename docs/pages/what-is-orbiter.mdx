# About

If you've been building on the web for the last several years you've probably noticed how complicated it has become. Stacks have grown into platform monoliths that provide a decent developer experience but in exchange have created vendor lock-in for a countless number of users. What happened to the old days where you could just drag and drop some HTML CSS and JavaScript? What about JAMStack where most apps were just Javascript, APIs, and Markdown? And of course, what happened to the web being fun to build on?

Orbiter was born out of these questions and the desire to build something better. We wanted to provide a simple hosting experience for apps, whether it was something as simmple as a static site, or a more modern stack like [bhvr](https://bhvr.dev). We also wanted to promote open web principles, encourage stacks that follow JAMStack principles where you can move your site or app to another provider with ease if you choose to do so. These are the things that made the web great, and the experience even better.

Whether you just want to drag and drop some HTML CSS and JS files, use a CLI, or use GitHub actions for automated pipelines, Orbiter provides simple yet elegant solutions that don't sacrifice developer experience. Our features include:

- Custom Domains
- Server Functions
- Analytics
- CLI and GitHub Actions
- Teams
- Custom Redirects and 404 Pages
- Version History and Rollbacks
- and more!

Beyond all the surface level features, Orbiter also implements [next generation p2p technology](https://orbiter.host/blog/how-we-use-blockchain-behind-the-scenes) to help ensure your site is available, open, and permissionless.
