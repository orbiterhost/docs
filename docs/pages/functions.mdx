# Functions

::::warning
This feature is still in Beta
::::

Funtions is a new feature that allows you to deploy serverless code connected to an existing Orbiter site. For example, if you have the site `bhvr.orbiter.website`, you can deploy server API code that would be accessible at `bhvr.orbiter.website/api`.


## Quickstart

This will get you started with a basic deployment to Orbiter Functions

::::steps

### Update CLI

Make sure the Orbiter CLI is at the latest version

```bash [terminal]
npm i -g orbiter-cli@latest
```

### Initialize Project

We recommend using Hono for this beta of Functions, so start a new project like so

```bash [terminal]
npm create hono@latest orbiter-server
```

Select the template that suits your preference.

### Update Export

Once it's ready to be deployed, make sure the export at the bottom of the file matches the following format:

```typescript [src/index.ts]
import { Hono } from 'hono'

const app = new Hono()

app.get('/', (c) => {
  return c.text('Hello Hono!')
})

export default app // [!code --]
export default { // [!code ++]
  async fetch(request: Request, env: any, ctx: any) { // [!code ++]
    return app.fetch(request, env, ctx) // [!code ++]
  } // [!code ++]
} // [!code ++]
```

### Deploy

In the root of your project run the following command to deploy your server!

```bash [terminal]
orbiter deploy --server
```

This will fetch your sites and ask which site you would like the server to be linked to. You must already have the client site deployed on Oribter!

The CLI will also ask for the entry path for your server code, as well as your desired build folder. This will do the following:
- Save your preferences to an `orbiter.json` file
- Build and bundle your server code
- Deploy it to Orbiter

If successful you should see a returned URL where you can access the API!

### ENVs

If you need to use enviornment variables in your server simple create a `.env` file with the values, then include the `--env` flag:

```bash [terminal]
oribter deploy --server --env
```

This will automatically scan your `.env` file and include them in the deployment request to Obiter. Orbiter will never be able to see your variables so make sure they are correct!

Orbiter is working on the funcitonality to update and edit ENV values in the web app
