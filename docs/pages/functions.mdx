# Functions

::::info
Functions are only available on paid plans, [upgrade today!](https://app.orbiter.host/billing)
::::

Funtions is a new feature that allows you to deploy serverless code connected to an existing Orbiter site. For example, if you have the site `bhvr.orbiter.website`, you can deploy server API code that would be accessible at `bhvr.orbiter.website/api/`.


## Quickstart

This will get you started with a basic deployment to Orbiter Functions

### bhvr

Orbiter's official stack [bhvr](https://bhvr.dev) (Bun Hono Vite React) offers the perfect setup to build a fullstack app that is portable and easy to use.

::::steps

#### Install Bun

Install [Bun](https://bun.sh) to your machine

:::code-group

```bash [Linux/MacOS]
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

```bash [Windows]
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
```

:::

#### Install Orbiter CLI

Install the Orbiter CLI with the latest version

```bash [terminal]
bun install -g orbiter-cli@latest
```

#### Create a New bhvr Project

Orbiter includes a special version of bhvr that has everything you need to have a fullstack app

```bash [terminal]
orbiter new --template bhvr
```

This will automatically install, build, and deploy the client and server packages of your bhvr project!

#### Deploy

Whenever you need to upload, simply run any of the `deploy` commands

```bash [terminal]
bun run deploy:client
bun run deploy:server
bun run deploy # Deploys both client and server
```

### Manual Deployment

If you prefer to use a different stack or separate repo for your server you can follow the guide below to setup Orbiter functions manually.

::::steps

#### Install Orbiter CLI

Make sure the Orbiter CLI is at the latest version

```bash [terminal]
npm i -g orbiter-cli@latest
```

#### Initialize Project

We recommend using Hono for this beta of Functions, so start a new project like so

```bash [terminal]
npm create hono@latest orbiter-server
```

Select the template that suits your preference.

#### Update Export

Once it's ready to be deployed, make sure the export at the bottom of the file matches the following format:

```typescript [src/index.ts]
import { Hono } from 'hono'

const app = new Hono()

app.get('/', (c) => {
  return c.text('Hello Hono!')
})

export default app // [!code --]
export default { // [!code ++]
  async fetch(request: Request, env: any, ctx: any) { // [!code ++]
    return app.fetch(request, env, ctx) // [!code ++]
  } // [!code ++]
} // [!code ++]
```

#### Deploy

In the root of your project run the following command to deploy your server!

```bash [terminal]
orbiter deploy --server
```

This will fetch your sites and ask which site you would like the server to be linked to. You must already have the client site deployed on Oribter!

The CLI will also ask for the entry path for your server code, as well as your desired build folder. This will do the following:
- Save your preferences to an `orbiter.json` file
- Build and bundle your server code
- Deploy it to Orbiter

If successful you should see a returned URL where you can access the API!

Whenever you want to update your serer you can just run `orbiter deploy --server` again, or if you want to run without a configuation you can use the `deploy-server` command:

```bash [terminal]
orbiter deploy-server \
  --siteId "LINKED_SITE_ID" \
  --entryFile -e "src/index.ts" \
  --buildDir "dist"
```

Info on values needed for `deploy-server`:

- `siteId` - The ID of the site that your server is linked to, can be located by clicking the "&#8505;" icon from the [dashboard](https://app.orbiter.host)
- `entryFile` - Path to the main file of your server, e.g. `src/index.ts`
- `buildDir` - The output location of your build directory, can be defaulted to `dist`


::::

### ENVs

If you need to use enviornment variables in your server simple create a `.env` file with the values, then include the `--env` flag:

```bash [terminal]
oribter deploy --server --env
```

This will automatically scan your `.env` file and include them in the deployment request to Obiter. Orbiter will never be able to see your variables so make sure they are correct!

::::tip
You can also edit ENVs inside the [Orbiter App](https://app.orbiter.host)
::::

### GitHub Action

By using `orbiter deploy --server` or `deploy-server` you can setup a GitHub action that will auomatically deploy your server anytime you push to your primary branch or on your own terms. If you are using `orbiter-deploy` Just make sure you have the following info:

- `siteId` - The ID of the site that your server is linked to, can be located by clicking the "&#8505;" icon from the [dashboard](https://app.orbiter.host)
- `entryFile` - Path to the main file of your server, e.g. `src/index.ts`
- `buildDir` - The output location of your build directory, can be defaulted to `dist`

Once you have these ready, run the following commands to create `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml` in the root of your project:

```bash [terminal]
mkdir -p .github/workflows
touch .github/workflows/deploy.yaml
```

Then paste the following into `deploy.yaml`, paying careful attention to use your own details in the CLI fields if you are not using `orbiter.json` that is created with `orbiter deploy --server`

:::code-group

```yaml [Manual]
name: "Deploy to Orbiter"

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Bun

          bun-version: latest

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bun install

          --entryFile src/index.ts # [!code hl]
          --buildDir dist # [!code hl]
```

```yaml [orbiter.json]
name: "Deploy to Orbiter"

  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Bun
        uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
        with:
          bun-version: latest

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bun install

      - name: Deploy to Orbiter
        env:
          ORBITER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ORBITER_API_KEY }}
        run: >
          bunx orbiter-cli@latest deploy --server
```

:::


You'll notice that this is looking for the environment variable `ORBITER_API_KEY`, so make sure on GitHub to go to `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions` and set your Orbiter API key there.
