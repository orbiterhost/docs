# The Orbit - Issue 2

![banner](https://marketing.orbiter.host/the-orbit-banner.png)

Welcome to the second issue of Orbiter's newsletter focused on the web and all its quirks, pockmarks, and beautiful nerdiness. Last week's newsletter seemed to be well received, so we are carrying on with this.

Let's get into it.

## Orbiter Bits & Bytes

Did you know all sites uploaded to Orbiter have version history? It's true! Every single update to your site can be accessed from the dashboard (or even the [CLI](https://orbiter.host/cli-reference/versions)) by clicking on the site info button, and then versions. From there you can see every version of your project, preview it, and in the case of an emergency you can roll it back!

It's something we often take for granted, but not when you need it most. Whenever you're using Orbiter you can rest soundly knowing we got your back ü´°

## Look, Ma No Lock In
The web is a wonderful place full of interesting people doing interesting things. We've collected a few of the things we found most interesting this week.

- Bluesky Comments - Commenting systems on blogs are hard and full of vendor lock in, but not so with Natalie's approach.

- CSS stretch? - You're probably familiar with 100vh or 100vw, but are you familiar with stretch and how it can be used?

- Non-Webkit Browsers on iPhones in Japan - A new Japanese law will allow non-Webkit browsers on iPhones, opening up the vendor competition in the browser space on mobile.

## Closing Thoughts
The web was once a completely handcrafted playground. It was art, and it was fun. Despite AI, and despite big tech, we think it can STILL be fun. We hope you enjoyed this issue!

Until next week, enjoy the open web!
