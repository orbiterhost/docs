# The Orbit - Issue 3

![banner](https://marketing.orbiter.host/the-orbit-banner.png)

Welcome to the third issue of Orbiter's newsletter focused on the web and all its quirks, pockmarks, and beautiful nerdiness. This week we're going to take you on a journey into the extremes of self-hosting and long-lived software as well as getting back to the basics with productivity, and more!

Let's get into it.

## Orbiter Bits & Bytes

For this week's Bits & Bytes we wanted to showcase workspace members! If you're on one of our paid plans you can add collaborators to your account with different roles. We think this is perfect for developers who need to help build websites for clients but don't want to manage billing or ownership of an account. Simply have the owner add you to the account and you can create and update sites to your hearts content.

Part of multiple workspaces? No problem! We have a special dropdown whenever you need to change context. This is how collaborating on the web should be: easy and simple! Check it our now on either our Launch or Orbit plans üí´

## Look, Ma No Lock In

The web is a wonderful place full of interesting people doing interesting things. We've collected a few of the things we found most interesting this week.

- Weathering Software - Imagine you want to have long-lived software that doesn't require an internet connection. You could look from some offline applications, or you could build your own virtual machine and operating system to code your own apps for!

- Single File Todo List - If you're like us (and most of the world) you've fallen victim to productivity tools don't make you more productive at all. How about just using a single .txt file?

- Only Open Source - Vitalik Buterin, the creator of the Ethereum blockchain, argues that for techno-optimism to work and for technology to do the most good, we should insist on supporting open source only as part of that progress.

- Anything is Possible‚Ä¶Still - A (mostly) positive outlook on the web.

## Closing Thoughts

Technology moves fast and things change. But one thing we should hold onto is that the web is the best operating system ever created. It's worth investing in and worth protecting.

Until next week, enjoy the open web!
