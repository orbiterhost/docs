# The Orbit - Issue 1

![banner](https://marketing.orbiter.host/the-orbit-banner.png)

We've decided to be more intentional with our newsletter, so we're asking you to hold us accountable. The goal is to put this newsletter out once a week, on Fridays. It will be a simple newsletter, as you'll see, but hopefully, it'll be a valuable one.

## Orbiter Bits & Bytes

One of the more under-the-radar features/products we've launched recently are server functions (serverless if you prefer the term). All paid plans have access to server functions, which makes Orbiter a fullstack hosting platform with none of the vendor lock-in. Let's take a look at how Orbiter's server functions work with a new framework called bhvr.

If you want to get started with server functions, you can sign up for a paid plan (starting at $7/month) and follow the docs [here](/functions).

## Closing Thoughts

The web is as fun as you make it. We want to make it funner more fun. If you're an Orbiter customer, thank you! If you're here for the newsletter, thank you! If you once tried to upload a phishing site, no thank you!

But seriously, if you're looking for an alternative to the mega companies with reasonable pricing and great service, consider a paid plan. After all, businesses should be expected to make money.
Until next week, enjoy the open web!
