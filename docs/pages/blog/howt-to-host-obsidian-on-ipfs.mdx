# How to Host Obsidian Vaults on IPFS

As technology has advanced and more services are shipped to the cloud, there is one thing slowly slipping through users fingers: ownership. A great example of this is in note taking apps. Apple Notes doesn’t have a raw file system where you can access your notes. Sure it can export them, but what happens if the note is gone before you can do that? How can you keep up as you continually edit them? Other apps out there like Notion (sorry Notion we love too) don’t have a local-first option and once again your work, your ideas, are stuck in a cloud. For those who truly hold a [“file over app”](https://bafybeia4jkmvp7sfhqne5fj73r72ypkxinyq3rwmgrmprh4wxjzll5452q.ipfs.dweb.link/) mentality there is really only one app that stands out: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

Not only does Obsidian store your notes as cold hard markdown files on your computer, it also hosts a multitude of features that can help you build whatever you truly want. Whether it’s a second brain or a simple journal, Obsidian is an elegant piece of software built on open tech principles. Hosting your Obsidian vault as a website isn’t anything too new, however hosting it on platforms that hold to an open web is a bit less common. Orbiter’s approach is novel and arguably hasn’t been done before, using a combination of [IPFS and blockchain](https://orbiter.host/blog/how-we-use-blockchain-behind-the-scenes/) that is totally abstracted from the user but open and accessible to anyone. In this post we’ll show you how you can host your Obsidian vault on Orbiter and heed to “file over app.”

## Installation and Setup

Getting your Obsidian vault and Orbiter site in sync does take a little bit of time initially, but once all our ducks are in a row, updating and adding to your site is a breeze. So grab your favorite beverage and let’s get started.

The first thing you’ll want to do is create a [free Orbiter account](https://app.orbiter.host). Once you’re logged in you can select one of the default site templates; don’t worry about the contents as it will soon be replaced by our Obsidian vault. Be sure to give it a unique name like “steves-vault.orbiter.website,” then click “create.” One more thing we need to do in Orbiter is make an API key. Visit the [Keys Page](https://app.orbiter.host/api-keys) and click “New Key” in the top right and select the “Member” role. Once the key is made save it somewhere safe!

We will assume you already have an Obsidian vault setup, but if you don’t you can do so by visiting https://obsidian.md and downloading the app. Once installed you will want to download the Digital Garden Plugin by click on [this link](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=digitalgarden). After you install it you will want to click the “Enable” button. We’ll come back to this plugin in a bit!

Next thing you’ll need is a free [GitHub](https://github.com) account if you don’t have one already. Once you’re signed up you’ll want to visit [this template](https://github.com/orbiterhost/digitalgarden?tab=readme-ov-file) and click the “Use this template” button in the top right.

Select “Create a new repository” and give it a name of your choice, then click “create repository.” From the files page click on the `.github` folder, then the `workflows` folder, and finally the `deploy.yml`. This file will contain a GitHub action that deploys our vault to Orbiter anytime there is a new update. Click on the pencil icon in the top right to edit the file, and replace the default `"my-site"` with the name of the site you deployed on Orbiter earlier, like `"steves-digital-garden"`. Once you do that click “Commit Changes” in the top right and confirm it.

Next thing we need to do is add our Orbiter API key to the repo secrets. Click on the Settings tab, then “Secrets and Variables”, then finally “actions.”

![CleanShot 2025-03-20 at 07.37.40@2x.png](https://cdn.orbiter.host/ipfs/bafybeid7txqbrfedwtwovab34wbku75cv55zwyftzh6dvnfa3yakxghoc4/3.png)

Click “New Repository Secret” and for the name put `ORBITER_API_KEY` and in the value box put your key, then click “Add Secret” to save it.

We’re almost done in GitHub, and there’s one last thing we need to make in order for our Obsidian plugin to work, which is a fine grained access token. Visit [this page](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens) and click “Generate new token” in the top right. Give it a name like `digital-garden-plugin` and an expiration date, or set it to not expire. For Repository Access select “Only select repositories” and then click the drop down to find the repo we just made. Once it’s selected expand the Repository permissions tab and find “Content” and “Pull Requests,” both of these will need to be Read and Write.

![CleanShot 2025-03-20 at 07.43.09@2x.png](https://cdn.orbiter.host/ipfs/bafybeid7txqbrfedwtwovab34wbku75cv55zwyftzh6dvnfa3yakxghoc4/4.png)

Finally scroll to the bottom and click “Generate token” and save it somewhere safe.

Now moving back into Obsidian, open your settings page and find the Digital Garden Plugin settings in the bottom left. Here you will want to fill out the information at the top such as the repo name, your GitHub username, and your GitHub Token that we just made.

We made it! Yeah that was a bit of a setup process, but you’re gonna love how easy it is to use from here 😎 

## Writing and Publishing Content

Let’s start making our first webpages and updates. Open Obsidian and make a new page called “Home” and write in some content like you normally would.

```markdown
# Title

## Welcome to my digital garden! 🌿

Hosted on IPFS and Base through Orbiter!
```

Now above our main header at the top of the page, below the title, paste the following:
